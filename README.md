# Sentiment Analysis

## Sentiment Analysis run Part 1: Build a complete pipeline for solving sentiment analysis problem

Open the terminal
```
python3 Part1.ipynb

```

In this part wer use different packages in Python to build a complete pipeline for solving sentiment analysis problem. We use the simplest model, Mutinomial NB. There are serval result plot will be shown

## Part 2: Word Embeddings and Neural Network

In this part we will use a powerful method to represent word in the numerical way and apply it to a simply 2-layer network for classification.

## Part 3: Build a deep LSTM network
In this part, we will build a deep LSTM network and insert a fixed pre-trained embedding layer in Keras

## Part 4:
